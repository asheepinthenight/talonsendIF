# Talon's End (Demo v0.1.5)
**Just want to play the game? Click [HERE](https://asheepinthenight.itch.io/talons-end) to play it on Itch or [HERE](https://asheepinthenight.github.io/talonsendIF/) to play on Github.**

But if you're looking to download a local copy of Talon's End, this is the place. Look for the latest release in the column on the right and download the index.html file. That's it!

A few tips:
1. Saves do not automatically transfer between devices or between online hosts (i.e. Itch and Github). You can transfer them manually to anywhere you're playing it by using the export and import functions in the save/load menu.
2. If you download a new version, overwrite the old one (that is: keep the same file name and path). Replacing an old version with the new will preserve your saves without needing to export and re-import them (but only if saves are compatible between versions).
3. Clearing your browser cache will delete your saves. You can export before clearing the cache, then import them again afterward.
4. Icons may break if you're playing without an internet connection. If you're playing on desktop, you can hover over them to see alt text to help you identify them.
